## Links
In this chapter I learned about links
Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute. For Example

## <a href="http://somewebsite.com">somewebsite</a>

The text between the opening tag and the closing tag is the link text, you link should be descriptive of where it will guide your user. Links are created using the a element which has an attribute called HREF. The value of the HREF attribute is the link that will direct people to the website. You can link to other pages within your site shorthand known as a relative url

## Directory  Structure
On larger websites you should  organize your code by placing the
pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a
website are sometimes referred to as directories.

- structure, this is where all the files should be created for each section of the site
- relationships, the relationships between files and folders on a website is described using the same terminology as a family tree.
- Homepages, is the main homepage of a site written in HTML.

## Relative URL's 
Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to
find your files.
