The structure portion of the book explains what exactly is a webpage and how a webpage is created. The content in this section is simple to understand and it gives you a visual of how a web page is started. Most web pages that you see online are hosted by a server that sends it to your computer, on that server is where all the HTML and CSS is for the page.
