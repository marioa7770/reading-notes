As a web developer the most important tool that you will use is a text editor. A text editor is basically a "space" where you type out all of your code to create your web page.

Macs and Window computers come with basic text editors that still work but do not offer the same qualities as and IDE. The main differences between a text editor and an IDE is that a text editor is basic, and an IDE An IDE is a text editor, a filemanager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package. With an IDE you can add extensions to make your life easier when writing code, you can think of an IDE like plug ins for your software.
