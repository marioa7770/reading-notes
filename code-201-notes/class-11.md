## Images

There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.

images should be 
-relevant
-convey information
-convey the right mood
-be instantly recognizable
-fit the color palette

If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses. To add an image to a website you need to use an <img>
element and it must carry the src attribute and the alt attribute.

You can place an image before a paragraph in your code, inside the start of a paragraph, in the middle of a paragraph. You can also align your image using the "align" attribute

The three rules for creating images are
-Save images in the right format
-Save images at the right size 
-use the correct resolution

There are several tools you can use to edit and save images to ensure that they are the right size, format, and resolution. Such as software
-Adobe fireworks
