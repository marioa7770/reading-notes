 In this chaper I learned about local storage. The operating system typically provides an abstraction layer for storing and retrieving application-specific data like preferences or runtime state. These values may be stored in the registry, INI files, XML files. Cookies were invented early in the webâ€™s history, and indeed they can be used for persistent local storage of small amounts of data. But they have three potentially dealbreaking downsides:

cookies are included with every HTTP request and it slows down your web application.

cookies are included with every HTTP request and sends data unencrypted over the internet.

cookies are limited to 4kb enought to slow your application.

what we really want is alot of storage space on the client, that persists beyond a page refresh and isnt transmitted to the server.

HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs. You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. The named key is a string. The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats. However, the data is actually stored as a string. If you are storing and retrieving anything other than strings, you will need to use functions like parseInt() or parseFloat() to coerce your retrieved data into the expected JavaScript datatype.

With Local storage you can save your game you are playing online instead of losing all your progress if you close the page this is the function we call on the game

function saveGameState() {
    if (!supportsLocalStorage()) { return false; }
    localStorage["halma.game.in.progress"] = gGameInProgress;
    for (var i = 0; i < kNumPieces; i++) {
	localStorage["halma.piece." + i + ".row"] = gPieces[i].row;
	localStorage["halma.piece." + i + ".column"] = gPieces[i].column;
    }
    localStorage["halma.selectedpiece"] = gSelectedPieceIndex;
    localStorage["halma.selectedpiecehasmoved"] = gSelectedPieceHasMoved;
    localStorage["halma.movecount"] = gMoveCount;
    return true;
}
