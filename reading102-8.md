#Loops and iteration#

Loops is a way to to do something repeatedly, there are various loop mechanisms that offer different ways to determine the start and end of a loop. Some are better situated than others, the following are the different statement for loops

-for statement
-do..while statement
-while statement
-labeled statement
-break statement
-continue statement
-for..in statement
-for..of statement

a for loop repeats until a specified condition equals false an example of a for statement is

for ([initialExpression];[conditionExpression;[incrementExpression])statement

the inital expression is executed
the condition expression is evaluated if the value of the condition expression is true the loop executes if false the loop terminates.
if present the update expression incremenetExpression is executed

A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks like this.

while (condition)
  statement
  
  If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
  if the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again
