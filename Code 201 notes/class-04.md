## Links
In this chapter I learned about links
Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute. For Example

## <a href="http://somewebsite.com">somewebsite</a>

The text between the opening tag and the closing tag is the link text, you link should be descriptive of where it will guide your user. Links are created using the a element which has an attribute called HREF. The value of the HREF attribute is the link that will direct people to the website. You can link to other pages within your site shorthand known as a relative url

## Directory  Structure
On larger websites you should  organize your code by placing the
pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a
website are sometimes referred to as directories.

- structure, this is where all the files should be created for each section of the site
- relationships, the relationships between files and folders on a website is described using the same terminology as a family tree.
- Homepages, is the main homepage of a site written in HTML.

## Relative URL's 
Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to
find your files.

## Normal Flow
In normal flow, each block-level
element sits on top of the next
one. Since this is the default
way in which browsers treat
HTML elements, you do not
need a CSS property to indicate
that elements should appear
in normal flow, but the syntax
would be:

## Relative Positioning 

Relative positioning moves an
element in relation to where it
would have been in normal flow

## Absolute Positioning

When the position property
is given a value of absolute,
the box is taken out of normal
flow and no longer affects the
position of other elements on
the page. (They act like it is not
there.) 

## Fixed Positioning

of absolute positioning that
requires the position property
to have a value of fixed.

## JAVASCRIPT Chapter 3

Functions let you group a series of statements together and perform a specific task, if different parts of the script repeat the same task you can re-use the function..
