## Forms
The best known form on the web is probably
the search box that sits right in the middle of
Google's homepage.

There are several types of form controls that
you can use to collect information from visitors
to your site

-Text Input
-Password Input
-Text Area
-Radio buttons
-Checkboxes
-Drop-down Boxes
-Submit Buttons
-Image Buttons
-File upload

Forms work by a user filling in a form and then pressing a button to submit the information to the server , the server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received.

##List tables and forms
 -List markers can be given different appearances
using the list-style-type and list-style image
properties.

-Table cells can have different borders and spacing in
different browsers, but there are properties you can
use to control them and make them more consistent.

-Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more
interactive

## Chapter 6 Events

When you browse the web, your browser registers different types of events. It's the browser's way of saying, "Hey, this just happened." Your script can then respond to these events.


When the user interacts with the HTML on a web page, there are three steps involved in getting it to trigger some JavaScript code.
Together these steps are known as event handling.

-Select the element node you want the script to respond to
-Indicate which event on the selected node will trigger the response
-State the code you want to run when the event occurs
