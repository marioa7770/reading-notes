# Summary of what I read

The structure portion of the book explains what exactly is a webpage and how a webpage is created. The content in this section is simple to understand and it gives you a visual of how a web page is started. Most web pages that you see online are hosted by a server that sends it to your computer, on that server is where all the HTML and CSS is for the page. Your browser on your computer interprets this code to create the page that you see. A web page can be basic and only have HTML and CSS and web page can also be more dynamic and contain flash and JavaScript

THe structure section talks more about how the structure of a webpage is set up, it breaks down the HTML for you . First it talks about elements which are characters that live inside the brackets <>, Elements are made up of two tags an opening tag and a closing tag. Tags act like containers They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.

- HTML tag indicates anything between it and a closing /HTML tag is HTML code

- The body tag indicates that anything between it and the closing body tag should be shown inside the main browser window

- Words between H1 and /H1 are the main heading.

- The closing body tag indicates the end of what should appear in the main browser window.

There are also different versions of HTML with each release showing improvements from the previous versions. HTML 4 was introduced in 1997, XHTML was introuduced in 2000 and HTML 5 was introduced in 2000.  HTML 4 is pretty much the same as HTML 5 except for a few added elements. XHTML requires that every element needs a closing tag, attribute names have to be in lowercase letters, all attributes required a value.

The Java Script section was interesting, it is broken down in three sections which is A - what is script and how do I create one, B - How do computers fit in with the world around them and lastly C - how do I write a script for a webpage. Scripts are like instructions that a computer can follow step-by step. A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user utilizes the webpage for example clicking on a certain link or using the search option on the webpage. To approach writing a script break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task
