## Chapter 5 Images

There are 3 rules to creating images

web page.

source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the
content of an image

them on the web page and in the appropriate format
- Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
