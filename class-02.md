## This is a summary of the TEXT chapter

This chapter starts of with what the meaning of "Tags" are and how they are used in HTML. HTML has six levels of headings 

- H1 is used for main headings

- H2 is used for sub headings

- H3 is used if there are further sections under the subheadings


There is also the 'P' tag which is a paragraph tag

The 'B' tag is used to **bold** the text

The 'I' tag is used to *Italic* the text

Superscript and Subcript are elements. The "SUP" element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or raising a number to a power. The "SUB" element is used to contain characters that should be subscript.

To make code easier to read web page authors add extra spaces or start some new elements on new lines. When a browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other  it only displays one space, if it comes across a line break it treats that is a single space.

Line breaks allow you to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph, you can use the BR/ tag to do this. To create a break between themes such as a change of topic in a book you can add a horizantal rule between sections using HR / tag.

In the CSS section it states that "CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration. CSS code sits in between 2 curly brackets and is made up of two parts a property and value seperated by a semi-colon. When writing CSS you can create a link to tell the browser where to find the CSS this link lives inside the head element.

- HREF specifies the path to the CSS file

- TYPE specifies the type of document being linked to, the value should be text/css

- REL specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to , the value should be stylesheet when linking to a CSS file.


## Chapter 2 Basic Java Script Instructions

In this chapter I learned a little bit about Java Script.
You write Javascript starting with a script which is a set of instructions that a computer can follow one by one, each instruction is known as a statement that ends with a semicolon. An important thing to remember is that Javascript is case sensitive so MARIO could mean something completely different if typed mario. Statements can be organized into code blocks by using curly braces, code blocks will often be used to group together many more statements and this helps programmers organize there code and make it more readable. You can also add comments by using forward slash before the statement // this can be used to give people reading your code a better understanding.

- Variables are created to temporarily store information (data), we use variables to "remember" data.

- When creating a variable we have to declare them you need to announce that you want to use it VAR and then VARIABLE NAME.
