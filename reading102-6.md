After reading the articles I feel like I have a better understanding of what java script is. The way I look at java script is like a robot, the HTML is the skeleton of the robot, the metal finish is the CSS, and what makes the robot move and power on is the Java Script. Java script is best know as the scripting language for web pages it is also used in non-browser environments. Java script is wideley used for controlling web behavior. Java Script allows you to implement complex features on a web page, a page can have animated graphics,music, scrolling abilities , moving text all thanks to Java Script. JavaScript is applied to your HTML page in a similar manner to CSS.CSS uses <link> elements to apply external stylesheets and <style> elements to apply internal stylesheets to HTML, JavaScript only needs one friend in the world of HTML â€” the <script> element. For Example
  
  <script>

  // JavaScript goes here

</script>
  
  I also learned the four common things that make up a computer are input, processing, storage and output. THe input of the computer would be what you tell the computer to do for example the keyboard. The information that is given to the computer via the input is stored in memory, a computers processor takes information from memory and manipulates it using an alogorithm it then sends the processed information back to be stored in the memory again, the output of the computer is what you see generated on the screen
