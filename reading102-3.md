it is very important to stay organized in git , after doing this exercise I found I had a bunch of duplicate files and a real mess going on, to be honest there are still a few things I can organize and delete a few extra files.
It is very easy to create unorganized files in git and have a bunch of extra stuff you dont need, and that is why this exercise was so helpful.
